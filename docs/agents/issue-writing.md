# Writing issues for Codex agents

Every implementation issue is a self-contained prompt for an agent that has no prior context. Use this structure, in this order:

1. **Problem (Why)** — one paragraph on what hurts now. Describe the constraint, not the solution.
2. **Goal** — one sentence on what changes when this is done.
3. **Sub-agent assignments** — table mapping each chunk to its manifest-resolved `f0rge-` primary, independent reviewers, deliverable and dependencies. Include the [shared protocol](protocol.md) and applicable context in each brief.
4. **Proposed approach** — high-level technical approach + reasoning. Design, not implementation. Each issue gets a dedicated per-issue planning pass before code is written.
5. **Files** — *Existing modified* (paths + line numbers where known) and *New* (paths to create). Starting points, not exhaustive.
6. **Out of scope (non-goals)** — stated positively ("do not change X"). Agents cannot infer from omission.
7. **Boundaries** — tiered:
   - Always: actions the agent can take without asking
   - Ask first: actions that need user approval
   - Never: hard stops (secrets, force-push, destructive ops, `--no-verify`)
8. **Acceptance criteria / Definition of done** — concrete, runnable, objectively true/false. **Must include a live-server walkthrough** for UI/API behavior, following the [QA gate](rules/qa-gate.md) — pytest passing is not the gate.
9. **Dependencies** — `Blocked by:` / `Blocks:` / `Required env / secrets:`.
10. **Rollback** — only when destructive or production-affecting. Trigger criteria + concrete revert steps.

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Vague acceptance criteria ("user can log in" — write "POST /auth/login with valid credentials returns 200 and sets `ht_session` cookie")
- Implicit scope ("just clean things up while you're there" — list every file)
- Bundling unrelated work (one issue = one cohesive change)
- Skipping the live-server walkthrough in favor of "tests pass"
- Omitting boundaries — without them, agents take defensible-but-unwanted actions

**Sizing heuristic:** if an issue's sub-agent table has more than ~5 agents listed, or estimated effort exceeds ~5 person-days, split it.
